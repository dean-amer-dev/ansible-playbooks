# ansible-playbooks — Agent Rules

## What Ansible is for

Server provisioning only:
- Installing OS packages and configuring system settings
- Adding users and SSH keys
- Bootstrapping new nodes (k3s join, Docker install)
- Correcting configuration drift on existing servers

## What Ansible is NOT for

- **Ansible does not deploy services.** Deployment is Komodo (stateful) or ArgoCD (stateless).
- **Ansible does not create Docker volumes.** Volumes are created by Docker on first compose start.
- **Ansible does not create PostgreSQL databases.** Databases are created by Tofu via `provision_app`.
- **An AI agent may run Ansible playbooks with Alex's explicit permission, granted per run — not a standing yes.** Sole exception (Alex, 2026-10-06): the gated `playbooks/infrastructure/rolling-reboot-debian-k3s.yml`, which the agent may run without asking (see `docs/debian-k3s/rolling-reboot.md`). Never in CI pipelines or unattended agent code (see below).

## One secret input: BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN

Every playbook reads exactly one secret from the environment: `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN`. No other secrets are accepted as playbook inputs — all other credentials are fetched from BWS at runtime using this token.

## Idempotency requirement

All tasks must be idempotent. Running a playbook twice must produce the same result as running it once. Use `state: present`, `creates:`, `changed_when: false`, and Ansible modules (not raw shell) wherever possible.

## Playbook template

```yaml
---
- name: <Describe what this provisions>
  hosts: <target>
  become: true
  vars:
    bws_token: "{{ lookup('env', 'BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN') }}"
  tasks:
    - name: Fail fast if BWS token is missing
      ansible.builtin.fail:
        msg: "BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN must be set in the environment"
      when: bws_token == ""

    # Fetch secrets from BWS at runtime
    - name: Fetch secret
      ansible.builtin.command:
        cmd: bws secret get <key> --output json
      environment:
        BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN: "{{ bws_token }}"
      register: secret_result
      changed_when: false

    # ... your tasks here
```

## Inventory

- `inventory/` — host groups and connection details
- `group_vars/` — group-level variables (no secrets)
- `all.yml` — cluster-wide variables

## Running playbooks

Playbooks are normally run manually by a human with:
```bash
BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token> ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbooks/<name>.yml
```

An AI agent may run the same command instead, but only with Alex's explicit
permission given in that session for that specific run — never inferred
from a prior approval, and never automated. Never run playbooks in CI
pipelines or from unattended agent code. The one exception is
`rolling-reboot-debian-k3s.yml`, which needs no per-run permission because
it is gated (one node at a time, healthy cluster and >= 2 healthy replicas
elsewhere required, stops on first failure); never bypass or weaken that gate.
